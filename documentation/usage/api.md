# Introduction

The HIASCDI Console is a REST API client for HIASCDI that is built in to the HIAS UI. The console has been designed to provide the functionalty required to interact with HIASCDI using the methods provided in the [FIWARE-NGSI v2 Specification](https://fiware.github.io/specifications/ngsiv2/stable/).

&nbsp;

# API Documentation

Version: 1.0.0

## Overview
The following is the API Documentation for the HIASCDI API. This API is based on the specifications provided in the [FIWARE-NGSI v2 Specification](https://fiware.github.io/specifications/ngsiv2/stable/).

## Secure HTTP Requests

API calls to the HIASCDI API are made using secure HTTP requests. The HIAS server protects the API endpoints with strong SSL encryption, a firewall and Basic AUTH authentication.

The following HTTP request methods are available:

- GET
- POST
- PATCH
- PUT
- DELETE

## HTTP Responses

### HTTP Success Response

- `description` (string): additional information about the response.

### HTTP Success Codes

- `200` `OK` - Request successful
- `201` `Created` - Resource created
- `204` `No Content` - Request succeeded, client doesn't need to navigate away from current page

### HTTP Error Response

The error payload is a JSON response including the following fields:

- `error` (required, string): a textual description of the error.
- `description` (optional, string): additional information about the error.

### HTTP Error Codes

- `400` `ParseError` - Incoming JSON payload cannot be parsed
- `400` `BadRequest` - Error in URL parameters or payload
- `404` `NotFound` - Resource identified by the request is not found
- `405` `MethodNotAlowed` - Requested method not supported
- `406` `NotAcceptable` - Request meme type not supported
- `409` `TooManyResults` - Request may refer to several resources
- `411` `ContentLengthRequired` - Context-Length header is required
- `413` `NoResourceAvailable` - Attemp to exceed spatial index limit results
- `413` `RequestEntityTooLarge` - Request entity too large
- `415` `UnsupportedMediaType` - Request content type not supported
- `501` `NotImplemented` - Request not supported

&nbsp;

# Authentication

Authentication is handled using the HIAS server security. Calls to HIASCDI must provide a HIAS user's key (YourKey below) in the Authorization header, authorization type **Basic**. A HIAS user's key is generated by joining the username and password with a **:** separating them, and then Base64 encoding the key.

```
headers = {
	"Content-Type": "application/json",
	"Authorization": "Basic YourKey"
}
```

&nbsp;

# API Resources

## API Entry Point

### Retrieve API Resources

This resource does not have any attributes. Instead it offers the initial API affordances in the form of the links in the JSON body.

It is recommended to follow the “url” link values, Link or Location headers where applicable to retrieve resources. Instead of constructing your own URLs, to keep your client decoupled from implementation details.

`GET` https://YourHIAS/hiascdi/v1

#### Response

| Attributes  |  |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| **entities_url**<br />required  | string<br />URL which points to the entities resource<br />`/v1/entities` |
| **types_url**<br />required  | string<br />URL which points to the types resource<br />`/v1/types` |
| **subscriptions_url**<br />required  | string<br />URL which points to the subscriptions resource<br />`/v1/subscriptions` |
| **registrations_url**<br />required  | string<br />URL which points to the registrations resource<br />`/v1/registrations` |

## Entities

### List Entities

Retrieves a list of entities that match different criteria by id, type, pattern matching (either id or type) and/or those which match a query or geographical query (see Simple Query Language and Geographical Queries). A given entity has to match all the criteria to be retrieved (i.e., the criteria is combined in a logical AND way). Note that pattern matching query parameters are incompatible (i.e. mutually exclusive) with their corresponding exact matching parameters, i.e. idPattern with id and typePattern with type.

The response payload is an array containing one object per matching entity. Each entity follows the JSON entity representation format (described in "JSON Entity Representation" section of the FIWARE NGSI-V2 specification).

`GET` https://YourHIAS/hiascdi/v1/entities?id=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000000&type=Robotics&idPattern=00000000-.\*&typePattern=Room_.*&q=temperature%3E40&mq=temperature.accuracy%3C0.9&georel=near&geometry=point&coords=41.390205%2C2.154007%3B48.8566%2C2.3522&limit=20&offset=20&attrs=seatNumber&metadata=accuracy&orderBy=temperature%2C!speed&options=

| Parameters  |  |  | Compliant |

#### Response

- Successful operation uses 200 OK
- Errors use a non-2xx and (optionally) an error payload.

## Create Entity

The payload is an object representing the entity to be created. The object follows the JSON entity representation format (described in a "JSON Entity Representation" section).

`POST` https://YourHIAS/hiascdi/v1/entities?options=

## Entity by ID

### Retrieve Entity

The response is an object representing the entity identified by the ID. The object follows the JSON entity representation format (described in "JSON Entity Representation" section).

This operation must return one entity element only, but there may be more than one entity with the same ID (e.g. entities with same ID but different types). In such case, an error message is returned, with the HTTP status code set to 409 Conflict.

`GET` https://YourHIAS/hiascdi/v1/entityId?type=&attrs=temperature%2Chumidity&metadata=accuracy&options=

| type | Comma-separated list of attribute names whose data must be included in the response. The attributes are retrieved in the order specified by this parameter. See "Filtering out attributes and metadata" section for more detail. If this parameter is not included, the attributes are retrieved in arbitrary order, and all the attributes of the entity are included in the response.<br />_**Example:**_ `temperature,humidity` | String | &#9745; |
| metadata | A list of metadata names to include in the response. See "Filtering out attributes and metadata" section for more detail.<br />_**Example:**_ `accuracy` | String | |

### Retrieve Entity Attributes

This request is similar to retreiving the whole entity, however this one omits the id and type fields.

Just like the general request of getting an entire entity, this operation must return only one entity element. If more than one entity with the same ID is found (e.g. entities with same ID but different type), an error message is returned, with the HTTP status code set to 409 Conflict.

`GET` https://YourHIAS/hiascdi/v1/entityId/attrs?type=&attrs=temperature%2Chumidity&metadata=accuracy&options=

| Parameters  |  |  | Compliant |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| entityId | Id of the entity to be retrieved. **(REQUIRED)** | String | &#9745; |
| type | Entity type, to avoid ambiguity in case there are several entities with the same entity id. | String | &#9745; |
| attrs | Comma-separated list of attribute names whose data are to be included in the response. The attributes are retrieved in the order specified by this parameter. If this parameter is not included, the attributes are retrieved in arbitrary order, and all the attributes of the entity are included in the response. See "Filtering out attributes and metadata" section for more detail.<br />_**Example:**_ `temperature,humidity` | String | &#9745; |
| metadata | A list of metadata names to include in the response. See "Filtering out attributes and metadata" section for more detail.<br />_**Example:**_ `accuracy` | String | |
| Options | Options dictionary.<br />_**Possible values:**_ `keyValues`, `value`, `unique`. | String | |

#### Response:

- Successful operation uses 200 OK
- Errors use a non-2xx and (optionally) an error payload. See subsection on "Error Responses" for more details.

### Update or Append Entity Attributes

The request payload is an object representing the attributes to append or update. The object follows the JSON entity representation format (described in "JSON Entity Representation" section), except that id and type are not allowed.

The entity attributes are updated with the ones in the payload, depending on whether the append operation option is used or not.

- If append is not used: the entity attributes are updated (if they previously exist) or appended (if they don't previously exist) with the ones in the payload.
- If append is used (i.e. strict append semantics): all the attributes in the payload not previously existing in the entity are appended. In addition to that, in case some of the attributes in the payload already exist in the entity, an error is returned.

- If the request payload MIME type is text/plain, then the following algorithm is applied to the payload:

	- If the payload starts and ends with citation-marks ("), the value is taken as a string (the citation marks themselves are not considered part of the string)If true or false, the value is taken as a boolean.
	- If null, the value is taken as null.
	- If these first three tests 'fail', the text is interpreted as a number.
	- If not a valid number, then an error is returned and the attribute's value is unchanged.

The payload MIME type in the request is specified in the Content-Type HTTP header.
