# Introduction

The HIASCDI Console is a REST API client for HIASCDI that is built in to the HIAS UI. The console has been designed to provide the functionalty required to interact with HIASCDI using the methods provided in the [FIWARE-NGSI v2 Specification](https://fiware.github.io/specifications/ngsiv2/stable/).

# API Documentation

## Overview
The following is the API Documentation for the HIASCDI API. This API is based on the specifications provided in the [FIWARE-NGSI v2 Specification](https://fiware.github.io/specifications/ngsiv2/stable/).

## Secure HTTP Requests

API calls to the HIASCDI API are made using secure HTTP requests. The HIAS server protects the API endpoints with strong SSL encryption, a firewall and Basic AUTH authentication.

The following HTTP request methods are available:

- GET
- POST
- PATCH
- PUT
- DELETE

## HTTP Responses

### HTTP Success Response

- `description` (string): additional information about the response.

### HTTP Success Codes

- `200` `OK` - Request successful
- `201` `Created` - Resource created
- `204` `No Content` - Request succeeded, client doesn't need to navigate away from current page

### HTTP Error Response

The error payload is a JSON response including the following fields:

- `error` (required, string): a textual description of the error.
- `description` (optional, string): additional information about the error.

### HTTP Error Codes

- `400` `ParseError` - Incoming JSON payload cannot be parsed
- `400` `BadRequest` - Error in URL parameters or payload
- `404` `NotFound` - Resource identified by the request is not found
- `405` `MethodNotAlowed` - Requested method not supported
- `406` `NotAcceptable` - Request meme type not supported
- `409` `TooManyResults` - Request may refer to several resources
- `411` `ContentLengthRequired` - Context-Length header is required
- `413` `NoResourceAvailable` - Attemp to exceed spatial index limit results
- `413` `RequestEntityTooLarge` - Request entity too large
- `415` `UnsupportedMediaType` - Request content type not supported
- `501` `NotImplemented` - Request not supported

&nbsp;

# Authentication

Authentication is handled using the HIAS server security. Calls to HIASCDI must provide a HIAS user's key (YourKey below) in the Authorization header, authorization type **Basic**. A HIAS user's key is generated by joining the username and password with a **:** separating them, and then Base64 encoding the key.

```
headers = {
	"Content-Type": "application/json",
	"Authorization": "Basic YourKey"
}
```

# API Resources

## API Entry Point

### Retrieve API Resources

This resource does not have any attributes. Instead it offers the initial API affordances in the form of the links in the JSON body.It is recommended to follow the “url” link values, Link or Location headers where applicable to retrieve resources. Instead of constructing your own URLs, to keep your client decoupled from implementation details.

`GET` https://YourHIAS/hiascdi/v1

#### Response

|   |  |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| **entities_url**<br />required  | string<br />URL which points to the entities resource<br />`/v1/entities` |
| **types_url**<br />required  | string<br />URL which points to the types resource<br />`/v1/types` |
