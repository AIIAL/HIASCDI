# Introduction
This guide will guide you through the installation process for the HIASCDI.

&nbsp;

# Installation
First you need to install the required software. Below are the available installation guides:

- [Ubuntu installation guide](installation/ubuntu.md)

**PLEASE NOTE** At this point both **HIAS** and **HIASCDI** should be **running** and you should be able to log in to the HIAS UI

&nbsp;

# Configuration

![HIASCDI Configuration](../assets/images/HIASCDI-Configuration.jpg)

The HIASCDI installation process will create the required JSON schemas and store the setup data. After installation you will be able to use the HIAS UI to manage your network configuration by navigating to **HIASCDI -> Configuration**.

You can also manage the HIASCDI device configuration using the
[configuration/config.json](../configuration/config.json "configuration/config.json") file.

## Entity Configuration

![HIASCDI Entity Configuration](../assets/images/HIASCDI-Entity-Configuration.jpg)

The HIASCDI Entity that represents the HIASCDI broker itself is automatically created during the installation process. You can manage the entity configuration in the HIAS UI by navigating to **HIASCDI -> Entity**.

You can download the credentials for HIASCDI by clicking on the Credentials download button.

&nbsp;

# HIASCDI Console

![HIASCDI Console](../assets/images/HIASCDI-Console.jpg)

The HIASCDI Console is a REST API client for HIASCDI that is built in to the HIAS UI. The console has been designed to provide the functionalty required to interact with HIASCDI using the methods provided in the [FIWARE-NGSI v2 Specification](https://fiware.github.io/specifications/ngsiv2/stable/).

Now that you have your HIASCDI installed, you can test the context broker using the HIAS UI HIASCDI Interface. Follow the [HIASCDI Console usage guide](usage/console.md) to learn about the API calls available to authenticated HIAS devices and applications.
