# Welcome

The **HIAS Contextual Data Interface** is a [HIAS Core](https://github.com/AIIAL/HIAS-Core) component that stores contextual data generated by the HIAS network and exposes it to authenticated data consumers via a REST API.

![HIASCDI Architecture](img/hiascdi-architecture.jpg)

 HIASCDI is a Python implementation of a [CEF/FIWARE NGSI v2 Context Broker](https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/display/CEFDIGITAL/Context+Broker). A context broker stores contextual data and serves it to applications by exposing the data through a REST API and pushing notifications through subscriptions.

HIAS devices and applications are the **contextual data producers** for the HIAS network. These devices and applications publish data to the context broker using supported machine to machine communication protocols and the REST API.

HIAS devices and applications are also the **contextual data consumers**. Devices and applications connected to the network consume contextual data generated by the network.

# Project Status

We are in the process of aligning the HIASCDI context broker with the [CEF/FIWARE NGSI v2 Specifications](https://fiware.github.io/specifications/ngsiv2/stable/), the code availble in this repository does not provide the complete functionality of an NGSI V2 Context Broker and is not yet fully compliant with the NGSI V2 specification.
